# Una Health Code Challenge

## Assumptions

Due to the nature of the challenge, I Have made some assumptions, in a real world scenario, access to product owner and other teams is available to clear out each assumption.

- The main value to record in a reading, csv file data rows, is "Glukosewert-Verlauf mg/dL" / Glucose Value, if non existant in a record, it will be discarded.
